h1. SVProgressHUD

SVProgressHUD is a clean, lightweight and unobtrusive progress HUD for iOS. It's a simplified and prettified alternative to the popular "MBProgressHUD":https://github.com/jdg/MBProgressHUD. Its fade in/out animations are highly inspired on Lauren Britcher's HUD in Tweetie for iOS. The success and error icons are from "Glyphish":http://glyphish.com/.

SVProgressHUD features:

* very simple singleton convenience methods
* optional loading, success and error status messages
* automatic positioning based on device type, orientation, keyboard visibility and optional @posY@ parameter
* talks with @setNetworkActivityIndicatorVisible@ (default can be changed via @SVProgressHUDShowNetworkIndicator@ constant)
* optionally disable user interactions while the HUD is showing with the @maskType@ parameter

h2. Installation

* Drag the @SVProgressHUD/SVProgressHUD@ folder into your project. 

__If you plan on using SVProgressHUD in a lot of places inside your app, I recommend importing it directly inside your prefix file.__

h2. Usage

(see sample Xcode project in @/Demo@)

SVProgressHUD is created as a singleton (i.e. it doesn't need to be explicitly allocated and instantiated; you directly call @[SVProgressHUD method]@) and can be shown using one of the following convenience/class methods:

<pre>
+ (void)show;
+ (void)showWithStatus:(NSString*)status;
+ (void)showWithStatus:(NSString*)status networkIndicator:(BOOL)show;
+ (void)showWithStatus:(NSString*)status maskType:(SVProgressHUDMaskType)maskType;
+ (void)showWithStatus:(NSString*)status maskType:(SVProgressHUDMaskType)maskType networkIndicator:(BOOL)show;
+ (void)showWithMaskType:(SVProgressHUDMaskType)maskType;
+ (void)showWithMaskType:(SVProgressHUDMaskType)maskType networkIndicator:(BOOL)show;
</pre>

__The previous @showInView:@ methods are deprecated. Using them with this version of SVProgressHUD will ignore the @view@ and @posY@ parameters, which are now automatically determined by the class.__

You dismiss it using one of these:

<pre>
+ (void)dismiss;
+ (void)dismissWithSuccess:(NSString*)successString;
+ (void)dismissWithSuccess:(NSString*)successString afterDelay:(NSTimeInterval)seconds;
+ (void)dismissWithError:(NSString*)errorString;
+ (void)dismissWithError:(NSString*)errorString afterDelay:(NSTimeInterval)seconds;
</pre>

If you're using SVProgressHUD to show the status of a many-steps operation, you can also change the HUD status __while__ it's showing with:

<pre>
+ (void)setStatus:(NSString*)string;
</pre>

Additionally, you can use SVProgressHUD to display a simple confirmation/success HUD using:

<pre>
+ (void)showSuccessWithStatus:(NSString*)string;
</pre>

h3. SVProgressHUDMaskType

You can optionally disable user interactions and dim the background UI using the @maskType@ property:

<pre>
enum {
    SVProgressHUDMaskTypeNone = 1, // allow user interactions, don't dim background UI (default)
    SVProgressHUDMaskTypeClear, // disable user interactions, don't dim background UI
    SVProgressHUDMaskTypeBlack, // disable user interactions, dim background UI with 50% translucent black
    SVProgressHUDMaskTypeGradient // disable user interactions, dim background UI with translucent radial gradient (a-la-alertView)
};
</pre>

h3. Network activity indicator

By default, showing SVProgressHUD will also show the network activity indicator (this makes sense for apps that make a lot of network operations). You can change this behavior by setting the @SVProgressHUDShowNetworkIndicator@ constant to @0@ in @SVProgressHUD.h@.


h2. Automatic Referencing counting (ARC) support

SVProgressHUD has an "ARC branch":https://github.com/samvermette/SVProgressHUD/tree/master-arc thanks to "bryanveloso":https://github.com/bryanveloso. If you'd like to use the non-arc version in your ARC project, you can disable ARC on a per-file basis by adding the @-fno-objc-arc@ compiler flag for those files (see "this StackOverflow thread":http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6646052/how-can-i-disable-arc-for-a-single-file-in-a-project for reference).
